# Handwriting recognition
This is a handwriting digit recognition project.

As I am studying network with python, I would just use numpy and matplotlib to build the network.

The training data is MNIST, and maybe something else.

## About the files
### deep-learning.py
This file contains the network and the main function. 
### mnist.py
This file loads the data. 
### functions.py
Some simple functions, like sigmoid and softmax.
